A lot of our people, my Mom included, they were diagnosed with TB per se. A lot of them were sent to this place. It's called Nanimo Indian Hospital. My Mom went in in 47, I was born in July. So, when I was two weeks old, almost towards the end of July, she went in. I think she was only 20 and she was in there for a good 15 years. She was in her thirties by the time she came out. So she lost a good part of her youth and her regular life. My Mom went in first, and then my Dad and then myself. I was in there I was in there from two years old to four years old. The only recollection I can have was, remember those old poseys they use to use. I don't know if they still have them. You know, when they restrain you. Anyway, I can remember being tied down to the bed so tight I couldn't move. All I could do was look up at the ceilings and I can remember hearing the others. The other children crying.

There's very few of our Elders left that talk about Nanaimo. My mom didn't. Even herself, she wanted to bury it; it was such a horrendous experience that they didn't talk about it. My uncles, there was about nine people that were coming for, they were survivors and it was from one Elder asking me if, if I could start up a group since Residential School meetings were set. They wanted something set up for Naniamo. So there was a number of Elders coming to my place, and we'd talk about the things that happened, experiments, everything, the medication that were done on them. It was very sad.

My uncle Sandy from Saanich, he was in there too. He can name a lot of the drugs that were given to him. He was beaten up a lot for asking.

Kuper Island Residential School. The two ran in conjunction with each other. When I talk about experiments, like the ECT treatments, to get our children into submission, the ones that wouldn't knuckle under to the priests and nuns at Kuper, they were sent to Nanaimo. There's about three of them that can recall that have talked about when they used to stick up for the little kids, so that they would decide then to send them to Nanaimo. Either through drugs or through ECT (mostly through ECT); the shock treatments, electric shock treatments, but these were done elsewhere like on the privates of the boys, you know, down below, and the women, the young girls; they would attach it to the nipples.

ECT treatments were done to them and it wiped out their memory, and then they came under the submission of everybody that was in control you know.
