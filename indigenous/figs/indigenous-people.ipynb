through decolonizing research methods:<p> a narative review </p></div>\n\n## Purpose\n\nThis report aims to:\n- Introduce issues surrounding healthcare for Indigenous Peoples: \n    - Ongoing struggles faced by the Indigenous Peoples and shed some light on those faced by other vulnerable groups (e.g. homeless and sexual minority groups)\n    - Causes of the health disparities in Indigenous communities \n    - Negatve health impacts from persistent racism and discrimination experienced by Indigenous Peoples  \n    - Inadequacies of current healthcare practices and quality care guidelines \n    - Indigenous research methods for the development of new healthcare interventions aimed at impoving the healthcare systems and practices\n- Provide proof-of-concepts on:\n    - Extracting text materials contained in PDFs archived on the web as a means to acquire Indigenous narratives [(example code snippet)](#pdf) \n    - Sentiment analysis [(example code snippet)](#spacytextblob)\n\nWe also hope to solicit ideas from the data science research community.\n\n**Keywords**: Indigenous Peoples, healthcare, violence, discrimination, racism, human-trafficking, patient-centric

Introduction \n\nIndigenous Peoples worldwide persistently experience inequitable access and greater health disparities when compared to the general population. These disparities include higher rates of chronic illnesses, suicide, mental health issues, violence, sexual assaults and abuses [(Turkington, 2020)](#turkington), [(Trembly et al. 2019)](#diabetes), as illustrated by the bar plots shown above (based on [2014 statistics](https://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/rp-pr/jr/jf-pf/2017/docs/july05.pdf)). \n\nThey have also been subjected to assimilation policies that led to negative impacts on the social determinants of their health. Many remain traumatized or affected by the harms inflicted by mandatory isolation of school-age children and crimes committed inside their residency in residential schools, as well as missing and murdered women, girls and 2SLGBTQQIA+ people in their communities. Other ongoing struggles they face include income inequality and inadequate housing. \n\nOne transformative solution to help address these problems is to embrace cultural safety throughout the entire healthcare delivery process. Cultural saftey can be enhanced by educating health profesionals, invite Indigenous health professionals into existing clinical practices, and modify clinical environments to foster culturally safe practices.\n\nAnother guiding principle is to actively integrate Indigenous Peoples' concepts of health during the process. Expanding the models of care from the Westernized medical model that focuses on symptoms and diseases [(Pene et al. 2021)](#maori), Indigenous views additionally account for:\n- Environmental factors\n- Interpersonal connections\n- Psychological well-being\n- Spirtual well-being\n\n<figure style=\"float: right\">\n<img src=\"https://github.com/lisatwyw/AI4SocialGood/assets/38703113/6c2b1b45-0f8a-4cb2-a3f9-8668772f4649\" width=500 />\n<figcaption style=\"float: bottom\">Source: Fundamentals of Care (FOC) framework (Feo et al. 2018)</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nOne conceptual paradigm adopted by nursing practices and patient-care providers is the **Fundamentals of Care (FOC) framework** that draws practioners' attention in a scientific and systematic way. The framework is still evolving over time; nevertheless, the current iteration of FOC does not sufficiently reflect how Indigenous views of health and healthcare delivery are being incorporated into existing FOC practices. Further, as illustrated in the right Figure, the current iteration does not address all of the elements listed above.\n\nThis problem is articulated in the findings of a study where [Pene et al. (2021)](#maori) analyzed 354 narrative comments collected in Indigenous patients' experience surveys relating to their satisfaction of healthcare services by New Zealand hospitals. Using an exploratory descriptive qualitative approach, the authors identified four *missing* themes as commonly described by the survey participants:\n1. Lack of understanding that their family is the fundamental support structure\n1. Inability to sense respect and kindness during their receipt of treatment\n1. Lack of inclusion of culture in the care process\n1. Unclear communication and/or ineffective partnership: rather than left alienated (e.g. when nurses did not explain their actions on their patients), patients being appreciated being constantly informed about each stage and made part of the decision-making process. \n\nEstablishing relational connections with the Indigenous Peoples during the entire patient care journey is of critical importance. Hence, in the **knowledge-action-integration (KAI)** framework, culturally responsiveness is promoted in person-centered care in which nurses are trained to have a broad and in-depth understanding of the health and well-being for Indigenous groups as well as how socio- culturual and political factors affect individuals. \n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 2.

In response, the Canadian Crown presented to Atikamekw Nehirowisiw the following statement:\n> Joyce's Principle aims to guarantee to all Indigenous people the right of equitable access, without any discrimination, to all social and health services, as well as the right to enjoy the best possible physical, mental, emotional and spiritual health.\n>\n> Joyce's Principle requires the recognition and respect of Indigenous people’s traditional and living knowledge in all aspects of health.\n\nSince then, **Joyce's Principle** was called for all healthcare and social services to uphold the respect and protection of internationally recognized Indigenous rights. In alignment with the Truth and Reconcilation Comission (2015), Joyce's Principle has led to the developments of the Indigenous Healthcare Quality (IHQ) Framework and the IHQ Platform in 2019 that collectively sets out specific instructions and guidelines on systems' approaches to ensure quality healthcare for the Indigenous communities.\n\nTo study the factors that contribute to positive healthcare encounters, the IHQF was developed using an Appreciate inquiry (AI) process, which involves a cycle of four phases:\n1. Discovery\n1. Dream\n3. Design\n4. Delivery/ Destiny\n\nIn the ***discovery*** phase, participants recruited from the Indigenous communities were invited to review their past experiences and record what they saw as the best characteristics of the current healthcare system. The ***dream*** phase guides the ***design*** phase by having participants share what they dream of the highest attainable standards of health. ***Delivery*** phase is then achieved by adoption of the IHQF on the system level.\n\nBased on their analyses, IHQF presents requirements on multiple dimensions:\n\n| | Basic human rights | Healthcare Systems | Healthcare Providers | Patient |\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Transparent communication |✓ |✓ |✓ |✓ |\n|Free of racism  |✓ |  |  | |\n|Equitable quality and outcomes | ✓ | | | |\n|Considerations of all determinants of health | ✓ | | | |\n|Cultural safety |✓ | ✓ | | |\n|Collaborative and continuous healthcare  | | ✓ | | |\n|Approachable, flexible, and accessible healthcare | | ✓ | | |\n|Nonjudgemental and compassionate | | | ✓ | |\n|Attentive, conscientious  | | |✓ | |\n|Efficient | | |✓ | |\n|Ethical | | | ✓| |\n|Validated and trusted  | |  | | ✓|\n|Loved, respected, and are fully seen| | | | ✓|\n|Grateful | |  | | ✓|\n\n# 2b. Solution: Decolonizing research methods\n\nIndigenous research methods are those that embody an Indigenous standpoint [(Walter & Andersen, 2013)](#walter), and may be defined as the collection and use of:\n- Case study (e.g. [an example](#case_study))\n- (Semi, un-) structured interviews pertaining to\n    - Personal experience \n    - (Third-person) lifestories\n- Introspection/ self-reflections:\n    - Observation of one's mental state\n    - Examination of one's soul\n- Cultural productions and artifacts\n- Observational, historical, interactional and visual texts\n\nConventionally, systematic reviews have collectively used the term **\"mixed methods\"** to refer to the combined use of qualitative methods with any of the above choices. As Indigenous Peoples are diverse in histories, beliefs, knowledge, languages, protocols, customs, and self-identities, it is important to emphasize that there is no single universal set of Indigenous methods [(Hayward et al. 2021)](#methods). \n\nRegardless, the limited engagement of Indigenous Peoples in quantitative researches have led to the \"Eurocentric\", non-Indigenous \"results\" that end up having no relevance to Indigenous communities. Decolonizing research methods thus aim to decentralize Eurocentric views in research methods by removing settlers' supremacy (of the White) by dismantling colonial institutions, modalities, systems and structures [(Hayward et al. 2021)](#methods). Research methods that actively embrace these objectives may adopt one of the following approaches [Drawson et al. 2017](#drawson): \n1. Contextual reflection (positionality)\n2. Inclusion of Indigenous Peoples in a reciprocal and respectful manner\n3. Priorize Indigenous ways of knowing.\n\n[Hayward et al. (2021)](#methods) further add to the above list:\n\n4. Community-based participatory research (CBPR);\n5. Indigenous data sovereignty;\n6. Strengths-based approach (aka \"desired-based\" inquiry).\n\n**Contextual reflection** refers to providing historical context to collected data, placing the Indigenous experience in the center of focus, rather than framing them from a world-view distance. An example of contextualizing Indigenous health disparities is the First Nations Regional Longitudinal Health Survey (RHS) that planned data interpretation to embed the First Nations' concept of health and informed the research process accordingly. As a concrete example, RHS connects culture and language as health indicators.\n\nSpeaking from the axiology standpoint, [Walter & Andersen 2013](#textbook) explain that Indigenous research should prioritizes Indigenous value systems. For instance, a study that collects Indigenous' housing situation should be tied to the possibility of housing remedies, or better, to evaluate the efficiacy of a social housing intervention. \n\n\nExamples of **CBPR** in Canada include the Building Bridges project that brought together Indigenous communities in Vancouver and Toronto to study and acquire data for people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in these communiites. Together with these communities, the Canadian Indigenous Nurses Asociation partnered with academic institutions to interpret the collected data. [(Hayward et al. 2021)](#methods) further suggest a meaningful extenion of this initiative, which is to invite a community-based researcher to facilitate research, as well as to monitor the entire procedure to ensure that Indigenous laws and protocols are closely followed and respected. \n\n**Data sovereignty** is built upon existing frameworks such as **FAIR (Findiable Accessible, Interoperable, Resuable)** and **CARE (Collective\nbenefit, Authority to control, Responsibility, and Ethics)**, principles that promote universal and fair access to data.\n\n**Strengths-based approach** aims to analyze data with a lens that is consistent with principles and values of the Indigenous community and to use the collected data to convey a \"positive story\" without \"altering statistical rigour\". When conducting studies, researchers should consciously remove the false assumption that researchers themselves are neutral and unbiased, since we are all socially situated [](#walter).\n\n\n\n## 2c. Realist and constructivist qualitative design framework\n\nAccording to [Biro et al. (2021)](#infographic), the health needs of sexual or gender minorities (SGM) are unmet when clinicians are inexperienced and uncomforable interacting with SGM. For instance, many LGBT adults have received inferior healthcare services and/or denied of services. Some also experienced breach of confidentiality, excessive curiosity from service providers, and denial of physical contact with the providers. Incompetent providers may lack SGM health knowledge, e.g. hormone therapy, and consequently avoid discussion and/or inquiries from SGM.\n\nTo overcome these serious inadequacies, [Biro et al.](#infographic) implemented an intervention that integrated a novel infographic into a clinical skills manual for first-year medical students taking a seminar on sexual history. The infographic extends the existing \"Genderbread Person Infographic by adding Indigenous perspectives, demographic data, etc. During the intervention, students were instructed to use the infographic to analyze questions, prepare discussions, peer role-plays, etc. The authors then evaluated the infographic via focus groups with the medical students. Some of the narratives collected from the students include:\n\n> \"I don’t know if this is too radical of a thought, but, we’ve kind of cartoonized this area of medicine. Like, we’ve turned it into this very pretty, like wishy-washy infographic, whereas no other weeks have we done that... it makes it less medical to me\" -- Student A\n>\n> \"...even though I guess it was explained, people .. cisgender versus transgender, what the differences were. So, I guess it was nice to have it laid down there.\" -- Student B\n\nThe authors then employed a **realist framework** to analyze and understand how and why their intervention worked and identified the underlying mechanisms, such as user-centric, participatory nature during the design process supported by student-faculty partnerships, which naturally engaged faculties to discuss stakeholder standards and needs with Indigenous and SGM in general while the students being the end-users got to steer the creation process. \n\n## 2d. Indigenize reports\n\nMost literature by anthropologists, explorers, and missionaries provided few insights into the cultural realities of Indigenous Peoples [(Younging 2018)](#younging). Late John Mohawk had argued that Darwininan concepts have placed Indigenous Peoples on the evolutionary scale between primates and *Homo Sapiens*. Literatures such as those written by Grey Owl and Chief Buffalo Child Long Lance also reinforce the stereotypical impressions of Indigenous Peoples as \"glorified remnants of the past\". Margaret Atwood summarized this in 1972:\n> \"The Indians and Eskimos have rearely been considered in and for themselves: they are usually made into projections of something in the white Canadian psyche.\n\nIn his book \"Elements of Indigenous Style\", Dr. Younging review in-depth different ways to overcome these barriers. For instance, \"Indigenous Voice\" uses Oral Traditions, borrowing inanimate, animal, and spirit characters from Traditional Stories to convey messages. \n\nAfter having studied their tribal history, language, religion, roles, appearances, politics, gender, and survival histories, writers should also consider adopting the following strategies:\n1. Converse with knowledgeable members of the tribes as a means to **secure tribal permission**\n2. Many authors have critized cultural misrepresentation and lakc of respect for Indigenous cultural protols in Canadian publshing. One approach is to invite Indigenous Peoples into your work as co-authors so they are offered the opportunity for input on how they like to be presented on your work. \n\n\n\n# 3.

This educational resource offers practical tips to support HCPs in providing inclusive, affirming and culturally safer care to 2SLGBTQIA+ individuals during pregnancy, birth and postpartum.Action is imperative at the provider level and must also take place at the organizational and health system levels to achieve sustainable change. PCMCH is committed to advancing health equity for 2SLGBTQIA+ communities through continued learning, engagement and partnerships to deepen our understanding of the healthcare needs and experiences of 2SLGBTQIA+ people and take meaningful action.2SLGBTQIA+ is an acronym that stands for Two-Spirit, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender/trans, queer or questioning, intersex and asexual. The ‘+’ is meant to be inclusive of additional sexual orientations, gender identities and expressions (including but not limited to non-binary and pansexual). Two-Spirit (2S) is a term used by some Indigenous people to describe their sexual, gender and/or spiritual identity, carrying various definitions and meanings for different individuals and communities. Indigenous conceptualizations of diverse gender identities, roles and sexual orientations have existed since time immemorial, yet the term Two-Spirit was coined by Elder Myra Laramee in 1990.Did You Know?The Ontario Human Rights Code prohibits discrimination and harassment because of sexual orientation, gender expression or gender identity.

Ask About Identity• Introduce yourself and your pronouns, and ask all people about their pronouns (e.g., he, she, they, etc.) to avoid making assumptions based on how they look or present• Be cognizant that sexual orientation and gender identity are fluid and may change over time• Use gender-inclusive language when addressing all people that are new to you (e.g., parent rather than mother/father)• Ask what name someone goes by rather than assuming that a birth name or the legal name written on medical documents is correct• Ask about gender identity, sexual orientation, sexual activity and kinship only if relevant• Ask about chosen family and support(s) to recognize that family configurations are diverse and to avoid perpetuating heteronormative assumptions about kinshipSome Examples:“My name is ... and my pronouns are ___ /___ . How would you like to be addressed?”“What do I need to know about your identity or your body that would allow me to provide you the best care?”“How would you like me to address you and/or your partner(s)?”“How would you like me to refer to your reproductive parts during care?”MARCH 2023www.pcmch.on.ca</p>"},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Example 3: case study <a href=\"case_study\"></a>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"%%time\n  \nfile_hd = open('../working/ctoolkit.pdf', 'rb')\ndoc = PDFDocument( file_hd )\npage_six = next( islice(doc.pages(), 5, 6))\n\nprint( page_six.Parent.Count, 'pages' )\n\n# time it takes to generate viewer is proportional to total file size \nviewer = SimplePDFViewer(file_hd ) ","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-09-01T00:21:22.763175Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-09-01T00:21:22.763639Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-09-01T00:24:59.453202Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-09-01T00:21:22.763596Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-09-01T00:24:59.451939Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":8,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"10 pages\nCPU times: user 3min 26s, sys: 10.3 s, total: 3min 36s\nWall time: 3min 36s\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"viewer.navigate(17) # the page number printed on the paper (not the widget)\nviewer.render()\ntext = \"\".join(viewer.canvas.strings)\nviewer.navigate(18) # the page number printed on the paper (not the widget)\nviewer.render() # need to render\ntext += \"\".join(viewer.canvas.strings)\nviewer.navigate(19) # the page number printed on the paper (not the widget)\nviewer.render() # need to render\ntext += \"\".join(viewer.canvas.strings)\nHTML( text.replace( '\\n', '<p>' ) )","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-09-01T00:24:59.455002Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-09-01T00:24:59.455683Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-09-01T00:25:01.300462Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-09-01T00:24:59.455648Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-09-01T00:25:01.299610Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":9,"outputs":[{"execution_count":9,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"<IPython.core.display.HTML object>","text/html":"12Wes Sam is a member of Burns Lake Indian Band. He first became interested in the non-medical cannabis sector while serving as Chief of his First Nation. At the time, recreational cannabis was not yet legal. Eight years later, Wes is now involved in the company Nations Cannabis, which at the time of writing, is a late stage applicant for a federal cultivation license. The Nations Cannabis production facility has 50,000 square feet of space and is located on fee simple land owned by the six First Nations associated with the Burns Lake Development Corporation. It will have a production capacity of 5,000 kg per year and will provide over 40 high quality jobs for the local community. Nations Cannabis is also committed to using as many local contractors as possible, which can help prompt diversification and economic resilience. The building they are repurposing into their production facility was used as part of a forestry operation in the past.While private investment has been crucial to getting this project off the ground, it remains majority controlled by the six First Nations. Being an authentic First Nations company has also helped attract supporters. Part of their vision is to strengthen Indigenous branding for cannabis products and work with First Nations across the country. In the future, Nations Cannabis plans to expand its capacity through an outdoor cultivation license, micro-licenses, processing licence, and international export license. The cannabis economy is full of creative options, from tourism and farm-to-gate operations, to industrial hemp, to cannabis by-products, and topicals.Wes describes the process that brought Nations Cannabis to where it is today, and sets out the steps that lie ahead. Firstly, starting up a cannabis business is a full-time job. It’s important to ensure you have support structures, good partners, and a fulsome plan in place. Cannabis businesses present great opportunities to participate in a new and exciting market, and contribute to regional economic prosperity and diversification. However, there is still lots of stigma, structural barriers, and market fluctuations that make cannabis particularly challenging as a business venture.  Case StudyLicenced Producer12BC Assembly of First NationsMay 2021Wes maintains that the biggest challenge has been securing sufficient capital investments. This was especially true when the COVID-19 pandemic hit and cannabis businesses that were still in the process of obtaining licenses were left in the lurch. Large banks still do not fully recognize cannabis ventures so it took some time for Nations Cannabis to develop successful relationships with financial institutions. He credits the networking and hundreds of presentations the Nations Cannabis team did for securing the capital needed. The team attended meetings, participated in social media groups, and kept meeting with potential supporters virtually once the pandemic started. Collaboration with like-minded individuals is key, and you really need to throw yourself into that crowd. One word of caution though, not everyone will have your best interests at heart so it’s important to develop a savvy understanding of what a good partnership looks like for you. Try to learn from every interaction and use it to inform your judgement.Wes also suggests taking advantage of the Health Canada Navigator Service, which is available to Indigenous-affiliated applicants. While there’s no special track for Indigenous applicants, the Navigator Service can be a responsive and informative source of guidance throughout the application process. For Nations Cannabis, it was helpful to have a direct line where they could ask questions.Forming and maintaining cooperative relationships with various levels of government was also crucial, as was engaging the community. Nations Cannabis received support from the federal, provincial, and municipal governments, as well as the regional district, and local First Nations. However, this required lots of communication. Wes would still like to see more support for First Nations cannabis businesses, especially around access to capital. Given the unique barriers facing the cannabis industry, guaranteed loans, purchase agreements, and supports for businesses still in the application phase would help emerging businesses. A decrease in application processing time is also crucial when you have already signed a lease for space. He believes governments are listening, but that the regulated market must continue to evolve quickly if it is to support a thriving sector. ”“It’s important to ensure you have support structures, good partners, and a fulsome plan in place.- Wes Sam ,  Burns Lake Indian Band13BC Assembly of First NationsMay 202114BC Assembly of First Nations Cannabis Tool KitFirst Nations Stories of Economic Development and Cannabis"},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### To inspect the meta data about the archived PDF, one could examine this:","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"viewer.metadata","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-09-01T00:25:01.301687Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-09-01T00:25:01.302534Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-09-01T00:25:01.313005Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-09-01T00:25:01.302479Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-09-01T00:25:01.311832Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":10,"outputs":[{"execution_count":10,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"{'CreationDate': datetime.datetime(2021, 7, 13, 10, 46, 53, tzinfo=tzoffset(None, -25200)),\n 'Creator': 'Adobe InDesign 16.2 (Windows)',\n 'ModDate': datetime.datetime(2021, 11, 8, 15, 55, 6, tzinfo=tzoffset(None, -28800)),\n 'Producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 15.0',\n 'Title': '',\n 'Trapped': 'False'}"},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Sources of narratives on ending violence\n\n\nAcoording to the conclusions of the National Inquiry's Final report, persistent and delibrate violations and abuses of human rights are root cause of violence against Indigenous and 2SLGBTQQIA groups.\n\nReiterate everyone's rights to health, culture, security, and justice, the report calls for four action items:\n\n- Centring Relationships to End Violence\n- Indigenous Recognitions of Power and Place\n- Emphasizing Accountability through Human Rights Tools\n- Colonization as Gendered Oppression\n\n\n- https://www.mmiwg-ffada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/20170530_MMIWG_Whitehorse_Public_Vol_1_combined.pdf\n- https://fnigc.ca/data/frequency-of-inability-to-meet-basic-living-requirements/\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# A4b.
